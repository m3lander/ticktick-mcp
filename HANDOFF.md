# Project Handoff Status

## Current Status (2024-01-10)

### Branch Situation
- Currently have both `master` and `main` branches
- Main branch is set as default on GitHub
- Attempted branch cleanup is failing due to unrelated histories
- Branch 'main' is up to date with 'origin/main'
- Working tree is clean

### Project Implementation Status
1. ✅ Core server implementation complete
2. ✅ TickTick API client implemented
3. ✅ Task resources implemented
4. ✅ Task tools implemented
5. ✅ OAuth2 authentication implemented
6. ✅ Basic documentation completed

### Next Steps

1. Branch Cleanup (Immediate)
```bash
# First check content of both branches
git show origin/master
git show origin/main

# Force push main's content to master
git push origin main:master --force

# Then delete master branch
git push origin --delete master
```

2. Implementation TODOs
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Add additional tools (projects, tags)

3. Documentation TODOs
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Add deployment guide
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

4. Testing TODOs
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] OAuth flow tests
- [ ] GitHub Actions setup

## Environment Setup
Required environment variables:
```
TICKTICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
TICKTICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## Next Session Plan
1. Resolve branch situation using the steps above
2. Begin test suite implementation
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Notes
- All core functionality is implemented and working
- Branch cleanup needs careful handling to avoid losing changes
- Test suite should be next priority after branch cleanup
