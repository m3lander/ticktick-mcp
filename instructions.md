# Next Steps

1. Connect to GitHub repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/m3lander/ticktick-mcp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Using poetry
poetry install

# Or using pip in a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -e .
```

3. Create your .env file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your TickTick API credentials
```

4. Next development tasks:
- Implement TickTick API client in `src/ticktick_mcp/client.py`
- Add task resource implementation
- Add task creation tool
- Add basic unit tests

The core server structure is in place. After connecting to GitHub, we can proceed with implementing the TickTick API integration.

I'll continue assisting with the implementation - let me know which component you'd like to tackle first!
